        <h1><u>A Brief Primer on Holons & Holarchy</u></h1>
        <img class='title' src="images/title.jpg" />
        <p>I am a complex system. You are a complex system. We both are a confluence of a higher order complex system. We all are part of a deeply intricate interconnected system that is composed of several orders of relationships between each other. This mega system that we inhabit ranges from the macroscopic view of deep space to the microscopic view of subatomic particles. Amidst the unknown extent of this mega system, you and I are sub-systems interacting with each other in a complex social sub-system. But what defines the functional stability and the structure of a complex system? Is it just a random association of units of meaning or is there an inherent order behind the chaos? And how can we quantify this association in a more holistic way? Arthur Koestler, a Hungarian writer and philosopher addressed these questions in his book The Ghost in the Machine, published in 1967. In his polemical writing and expressive ouvre, he re-introduces the Parable of the Two Watchmakers, originally introduced by Nobel Prize Winner Herbert A. Simon, which goes as follows in my own elaboration of it.</p>
        <h3>The Parable of the Two Watchmakers</h3>
        <p>Two Swiss watchmakers Mekhos and Bios prepared exquisite watches. Both their watches were in high demand. However, Bios prospered and Mekhos had to ultimately close his shop down. This was the outcome of their individual methods of producing their watches. Both their watches consisted of about one thousand parts. Where Mekhos assembled his watch bit by bit, Bios had designed a method of making watches by conjoining about ten components into sub-assemblies, each of which held together as an independent unit. Ten of these sub-assemblies could fit together into a sub-system of a higher order, which constituted the whole watch. This led Simon to conclude that “Complex systems will evolve from simple systems much more rapidly if there are stable intermediate forms than if there are not. The resulting complex forms will be hierarchic…We have only to turn the argument around to explain the observed predominance of hierarchies among the complex systems Nature presents to us...”</p>
        <h3>Holon</h3>
        <p>Koestler uses this story to elicit his point that the hierarchical organisation of systems is an inbuilt feature of life – biological life but also any complex evolving system. Thus he claims that a complex system will evolve much quickly from simple systems if there are stable intermediate forms as hierarchies. These forms can be analyzed as nodes that define the structure of stability. He called them Holons. It is derived from Greek word holos-, which means whole, and -on, that comes from atomic parts like electron, proton, to represent a particle or part; thus whole-part. A hierarchy of Holons is called a Holarchy. The branches of a Holarchy are the channels of communication or the flow of information between several Holons that are related to each other. A Holon is a node in the structure of a hierarchy that addresses the ambiguity between ‘part’ and ‘whole.’ A ‘part’ is a fragment, a piece of the puzzle, which doesn’t have its own legitimate existence. But a ‘whole’ is something that’s complete in itself;  an autonomous independent unit. But Koestler claims that ‘wholes’ and ‘parts’ don’t really exist anywhere. Neither in the domain of living organisms or in social organisations. However, what we observe are intermediate structures at various levels in an ascending order of complexity. What spans these levels are Holons, that show the characteristics of ‘whole’ and a ‘part’ depending on the direction we look at them. For example, in the semantics of language, sentences, phrases, words, and letters are whole in their own right but also parts of a larger unit; similarly, cells, tissues, organs or family, community, society act within the confines of a whole-part duality.</p>

        <h3>Janus Principle</h3>
        <p>A Holon, as Koestler called it, is Janus-faced. He uses the metaphor of Janus, a two-faced Roman god, to represent the polarity of a Holon. The face that points inwards towards its subordinate parts is that of the whole; the face pointing upwards towards the apex is that of a dependent part. He claims that man is not an island; he is a Holon. As a whole, a human being is intrinsically an autonomous, self-contained unit that is made up of levels of sub-systems inside its body. Additionally, extrinsically it is part of a social community, state and a nation; something bigger than itself to which it contributes. This polarized phenomenon of a Holon is called the Janus Principle.</p>
     
        <h3>Computational Holarchy</h3>
        <p>To understand the concepts of a Holon and Holarchy, I created a computational tool to model a Holarchic system. This tool creates Holarchy with a bottoms-up approach by creating an initial population of Holons. Every Holon is a concrete shape, a window of information, an abstract unit of meaning represented by its colored identity, whose height and width depends upon the depth of the Holarchy. Depth is the actual number of rows or levels in the system, through which a Holarchy evolves. In a contrived system like this, I can set the depth to a fixed number. This is the number of evolutionary iterations the system makes before concluding the Holarchy. At every level, multiple Holons combine based on certain rules. For this system, there are 2 basic rules. 
        Rule #1
        Two consecutive Holons combine together to procreate the Holon in the next level. Width of the new Holon is equal to the sum of the widths of its parents.
        Rule #2 
        Each Holon sends a certain amount of its color property to the next Holon. The colors mix together in a predetermined ratio. 
        Depending on the type and order of the initial Holons, and the assigned flavor of rules, a Holarchy emerges that is completely unpredictable and surprising. This phenomenon is called Emergence, which is an inherent characteristic of a Holonic system.

        <p>Above are some of the results from this system. The point to be noted in these results is that every Holon (rectangular unit of information) has a self-assertiveness or a functional presence that defines its wholeness as a concrete individual unit. It has individuality and a certain degree of autonomy that it must maintain. On the other hand, it has integral characteristics, which makes it a subordinate entity to maintain the structure of the whole, which it is a part of. Without its partly nature, its descendants will not look the way they look like in the current Holarchy. Therefore, these Holonic tendencies on every level of a Holarchy are responsible for the stability of a complex system. </p>
        <h3>Open-Ended Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Even though this contrived system has a potential to create snapshots of endless Holarchic variations, these are severely reduced in its nature. In a Holarchy, the whole isn’t actually a sum of its parts. Also, in the real world, the social holarchies that we are a part of are constantly moving, self-organizing, and open-ended. These complex social systems behave like a living organism that is constantly reproducing, mutating, evolving, and self-maintaining; thus autopoietic in nature. Below is an open-ended iteration of this computation tool, where every level of the Holarchy is constantly evolving and self-organizing. Arthur Koestler refers to the complex system as the machinery and evolution process that it goes through in maintaining its stability as the ghost. Here, the ghost lies in the algorithm that evolves this visual machinery.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I believe the concept of a Holon can be used as an epistemic device to quantify a complex system to understand the flow of control and information in our society. A society without a hierarchical structure would be chaotic. However, no society has a single monolithic structure. It is structured by several interlocking hierarchies, where each Holon-whether administrative department, a local government or a community club operates as an autonomous, individual, self-contained unit. However, it’s subject to control and communication from the upper echelons, while maintaining its independence and identity to function as a unique entity. Without the division of labour and delegation of powers, using a holarchic schema, no society can function effectively. Therefore, by internalizing the functional (whole) and structural (part) properties of a Holon, we can project a holistic image of a complex society.
